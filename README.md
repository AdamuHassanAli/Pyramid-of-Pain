# Pyramid of Pain Lab
<b>Platform:</b> TryHackMe | <b>Type:</b> Hands-On Lab | <b>Focus:</b> Adversary Disruption, Indicator Analysis, Threat Hunting
<h2>Overview:</h2>
This lab explored the Pyramid of Pain threat intelligence model developed by David J. Bianco, which categorizes indicators of compromise (IOCs) based on how much they “hurt” the adversary when detected or mitigated. The pyramid helped me understand the strategic value of different indicators—from simple file hashes to complex attacker behaviors.

Levels covered in the lab:

Hash Values – Identifying file-based malware signatures

IP Addresses – Detecting adversary infrastructure

Domain Names – Tracing phishing and command & control domains

Host and Network Artifacts – Uncovering system changes and unusual traffic

Tools – Recognizing attacker frameworks like Cobalt Strike

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) – Understanding adversary methodology through the MITRE ATT&CK framework

What I Learned:

How to identify and prioritize IOCs based on adversary pain level

How to analyze threat behaviors using network and host forensic data

The strategic advantage of targeting higher-order indicators (TTPs, Tools)

How threat hunters can use frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK alongside the Pyramid of Pain

How attacker agility varies depending on the type of detection in place

Skills Gained:

IOC classification and enrichment

Threat intelligence analysis

Defensive prioritization based on adversary cost

Use of MITRE ATT&CK for mapping TTPs

Foundational threat hunting and blue teaming techniques

Outcome:
This lab enhanced my ability to think like a defender by focusing not just on detecting attacks, but on maximizing impact to adversaries. I now understand how to apply the Pyramid of Pain model to build more resilient detection strategies that disrupt adversary operations at a behavioral level.
